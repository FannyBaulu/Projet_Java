# LORDS MOBILE GUIDE

This software allows Lords mobile's user to select, according to the pieces of gear he possess, the best choice of equipement to fulfill one purpose:
can be the best gear for attacking other players or the best gear to build up his castle,etc...
We choose to make this software to make this selection of gear easier for the player. In the game, you can be easily lost in the choice of equipement since there is so many pieces of gear available.
We also gave the possibility to the user to get the best choice from what he possess which is not possible to do inside the game.


### Requirements:

In order to use this software, you will need to following programms:

- Eclipse 2019-09 R
